# pykitti
![KITTI](pykitti.png)

This package provides a minimal set of tools for working with the KITTI dataset [[1]](#references) in Python. So far only the raw datasets and odometry benchmark datasets are supported, but we're working on adding support for the others. We welcome contributions from the community.

## Installation

### Using pip
You can install pykitti via pip using
```
pip install pykitti
```

### From source
To install the package from source, simply clone or download the repository to your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/utiasSTARS/pykitti.git
```
and run the provided setup tool
```
cd pykitti
python setup.py install
```

## Notation
Homogeneous coordinate transformations are provided as 4x4 `numpy.array` objects and are denoted as `T_destinationFrame_originFrame`.

Pinhole camera intrinsics for camera `N` are provided as 3x3 `numpy.array` objects and are denoted as `K_camN`. Stereo pair baselines are given in meters as `b_gray` for the monochrome stereo pair (`cam0` and `cam1`), and `b_rgb` for the color stereo pair (`cam2` and `cam3`).

## Example
More detailed examples can be found in the `demos` directory, but the general idea is to specify what dataset you want to load, then access the parts you need and do something with them:

```python
import pykitti

basedir = '/your/dataset/dir'
date = '2011_09_26'
drive = '0019'

# The 'frames' argument is optional - default: None, which loads the whole dataset.
# Calibration and timestamp data are read automatically. 
# Other sensor data (cameras, IMU, Velodyne) are available via generators.
data = pykitti.raw(basedir, date, drive, frames=range(0, 50, 5))

# dataset.calib:      Calibration data are accessible as a named tuple
# dataset.timestamps: Timestamps are parsed into a list of datetime objects
# dataset.oxts:       Generator to load OXTS packets as named tuples
# dataset.camN:       Generator to load individual images from camera N
# dataset.gray:       Generator to load monochrome stereo pairs (cam0, cam1)
# dataset.rgb:        Generator to load RGB stereo pairs (cam2, cam3)
# dataset.velo:       Generator to load velodyne scans as [x,y,z,reflectance]

point_velo = np.array([0,0,0,1])
point_cam0 = data.calib.T_cam0_velo.dot(point_velo)

point_imu = np.array([0,0,0,1])
point_w = [o.T_w_imu.dot(point_imu) for o in data.oxts]

cam0_image = next(data.cam0)
cam2_image, cam3_image = next(data.rgb)
```
### OpenCV
Image data can be automatically converted to an OpenCV-friendly format (i.e., `uint8` with `BGR` color channel ordering) simply by specifying an additional parameter in the constructor:

```python
data = pykitti.raw(basedir, date, drive, frames=range(0, 50, 5), imformat='cv2')
```

Note: This package does not actually require that OpenCV be installed on your system, except to run `demo_raw_cv2.py`.
